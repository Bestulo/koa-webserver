# Introduction

I wanted to make a Koa server with Mustache that would be easily exportable. This is a very simple server. Just install it, put your files in the folders and it runs smoothly.

# Folders

* Explanations for anything, especially complicated things, go in `/docs`.
* Repeatable pieces of html go in `/partials`
* Variable definitions go in `/views`
* All static files (js, css, etc.) and mustache documents go in `/public`

# License

I don't care what you do with this. I did it for myself. No credit necessary. Take whatever you want and don't look back. Pull requests, issues, whatever, are welcome.
